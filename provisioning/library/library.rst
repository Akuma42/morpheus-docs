Library
=======

Overview
--------

The Library section is used to add virtual images as custom instances to the provisioning catalog. The Library Section is composed of:

* Instance Types
* Layouts
* Node Types
* Option Types
* Option Lists
* File Templates
* Scripts
* Spec Templates
* Cluster Layouts

Uploaded or synced images from the virtual images section are added to nodes, a node or multiple nodes are added to layouts, and layouts are added to Instance Types. Scripts and File Templates can be attached to nodes, with phased execution options for scripts.
