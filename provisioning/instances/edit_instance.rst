Edit Instances
===============

|morpheus| allows for the ability to edit an instance once it has been provisioned.  There are several fields that can be edited.

* Name
* Description
* Environment
* Group
* Metadata
* Tags
* Owner

The environment, group and owner fields must be set to previously defined options in |morpheus|.

Name, description , metadata and tags are free form fields that allow you to add additional information to your instance.
