The Recent Activity panel displays your recent activity. We define an activity as any major action performed on an instance or server, such as, but not limited to adding a server, deleting a server, provisioning an instance, deleting an instance, creating a backup, etc… This view can be searched and filtered by type, user, and date range.

There are 5 types of activities that are displayed: Provisioning,Monitoring, Alert, Backups, and Logs.

To review the item of the activity that occurred click the name of the activity and it will goto a new page and display that item.

Here are two examples:

If you have the recent activity “Provisioning - TestDb” and click the activity name it will goto the instance ‘Testdb’.
If you have the recent activity ‘Backup - Testdb container 132 backup’ and click the activity name it will goto the backup ‘Testdb container 132 backup’.
Note: Delete activities are displayed as an alert and do not contain a link to the event item. If the activity is not a deletion event we provide a link on the activity name to goto the item the activity occurred on.
