== Installation

Morpheus comes packaged as a `debian` or `yum` based package. It can be installed on a single on/off premise linux based host or configured for high availability and horizontal scaling. Morpheus is currently only supported on Ubuntu 14.04 , CentOS 7.0 or newer, and RHEL 7.0 or newer based hosts (Ubuntu is recommended).
