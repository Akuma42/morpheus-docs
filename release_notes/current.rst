New Features
============

Agents: FIPS enabled packages installed when FIPS is enabled on target
  Morpheus will now use FIPS enabled agent packages when FIPS is enabled.

  - The Agent install process will detect if FIPS is enabled on the target VM or Host, and then call the package `morpheus-node-fips` or `morpheus-vm-node-fips` instead of the non-FIPS compliant packages during the agent install process.
  - The Appliance repo will contain both non-FIPS and FIPS package versions.

Agent: SSL Verification of Agent Communications option added
  SSL Verification of Agent Communications can now be enforced.

  - ``Enable SSL Verification of Agent`` toggle added to ``/admin/settings#!appliance``
  - Enabling SSL Verification of Agent Communications requires a valid Certificate be installed on the Appliance.
    - If ``Enable SSL Verification of Agent`` is enabled and the Appliance has a valid 3rd party SSL Certificate and the verify peer is set on the Agent, the Agent can connect to the Appliance.
    - If ``Enable SSL Verification of Agent`` is enabled and the Appliance has a self-signed Certificate  (default), the Agent will not be able to connect to the Appliance.
    - SSL Verification of Agent Communications requires the node's Agent configuraiton to have ``morphd['verify_peer'] = true`` set in ``/etc/morpheus/morpheus-node.rb``.

Apps: Kubernetes: Spec-Based App: Parsing errors surfaced
  When provisioning Kubernetes Spec-Based Apps, syntax and/or parsing errors are now surfaced in the UI.
Appliance: Redis removed
  Redis has been removed for security enhancements. Redis is no longer installed or needed.
Appliance: Elasticsearch 7 upgrade
  4.1.2 installs and requires Elasticsearch v7.x.
   - For Appliances with the default local Elasticsearch, no action is required.
   - For existing Appliances using an external Elasticsearch Host, Cluster or Service, Elasticsearch v7.x upgrade is required.
   - New installations require any external Elasticsearch Host, Cluster or Service to be on Elasticsearch v7.x.
   - Elasticsearch v5.6 was the previous version used by Morpheus. Please refer to Elasticsearch Upgrade Documentation for upgrade instructions.
  .. important:: Elasticsearch 7 is required for v4.1.2+. Running Morpheus v4.1.2+ with Elasticsearch 5.x or 6.x is NOT supported."

   - To change an Azure Cloud Account Type from Standard to either CSP or EA pricing, in ``Infrastructure -> Clouds``, edit the target Azure Cloud. In the Details section, select Standard, CSP, or EA from the ACCOUNT TYPE dropdown. Select SAVE CHANGES. A new cloud sync will be triggered and the specified Account Type pricing will sync.
       .. note:: CSP and EA pricing sync is only available for Azure EA (Enterprise Agreement) and CSP (Cloud Solution Provider) subscriptions.
