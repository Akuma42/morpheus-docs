Fixes
=====

- Removed a hard-coded message stating "You have logged out of morpheus." when users who were authenticated through a SAML integration logged out. This could cause confusion when using white-labeled Morpheus appliances.
- Removed a message stating "If supported by your identity provider and configuration, you have also been logged out of your identity provider" that appeared in some instances when logging out of |morpheus| through Identity Source authentication
- Fixed an issue where the HISTORY tab of an ARM Blueprint App detail page would only show deployment information if a VM resource was being deployed
- Creation of networks and routers are now asynchronous processes to improve performance and prevent modal timeout in some scenarios
- Updated |morpheus| installer to force a version of FreeRDP which is compatible with Guacd. CentOS/RHEL 7.7+ include FreeRDP 2.0 by default which is not compatible.
- The Activity page (Operations > Activity) now identifies actions taken by impersonated Users in the same way they are on the Dashboard (Operations > Dashboard), for example, "Author: User1 as User2"
- Fixed an issue where the reconfigure function did not work properly on Instances provisioned to a kubernetes host in some cases
- Fixed an issue preventing a second router from being added to a |morpheus|-created Openstack network in certain scenarios
