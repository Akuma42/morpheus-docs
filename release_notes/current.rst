|morphver| Release Notes
*************************

.. important:: v4.1.2 requires Elasticsearch v7.x. Please refer to :ref:`upgrading` and `Elasticsearch Upgrade Documentation <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/setup-upgrade.html>`_ before installing or upgrading to v4.1.2 if your Appliance's Elasticsearch is external.

.. important:: v3.6.0 or later required to upgrade to 4.1.2. Upgrading from v3.6.x to v4.x contains upgrades to MySQL, RabbitMQ, and Elasticsearch. Please refer to Upgrade Requirements before upgrading. When upgrading from v3.6.x to v4.x a database backup is recommended due to MySQL version upgrade.

.. important:: It is recommend to upgrade existing VM and Host Agents after upgrading to |morphver| for Automation tasks with large task outputs/results when executing over |morpheus| Agent Command Bus.

New Features
============

Agents: FIPS enabled packages installed when FIPS is enabled on target
  |morpheus| will now use FIPS enabled agent packages when FIPS is enabled.

  - The Agent install process will detect if FIPS is enabled on the target VM or Host, and then call the package `morpheus-node-fips` or `morpheus-vm-node-fips` instead of the non-FIPS compliant packages during the agent install process.
  - The Appliance repo will contain both non-FIPS and FIPS package versions.

Agent: SSL Verification of Agent Communications option added
  SSL Verification of Agent Communications can now be enforced.

  - ``Enable SSL Verification of Agent`` toggle added to ``/admin/settings#!appliance``
  - Enabling SSL Verification of Agent Communications requires a valid Certificate be installed on the Appliance.
    - If ``Enable SSL Verification of Agent`` is enabled and the Appliance has a valid 3rd party SSL Certificate and the verify peer is set on the Agent, the Agent can connect to the Appliance.
    - If ``Enable SSL Verification of Agent`` is enabled and the Appliance has a self-signed Certificate  (default), the Agent will not be able to connect to the Appliance.
    - SSL Verification of Agent Communications requires the node's Agent configuration to have ``morphd['verify_peer'] = true`` set in ``/etc/morpheus/morpheus-node.rb``.

Appliance: Elasticsearch 7 upgrade
  4.1.2 installs and requires Elasticsearch v7.x.
   - For Appliances with the default local Elasticsearch, no action is required.
   - For existing Appliances using an external Elasticsearch Host, Cluster or Service, Elasticsearch v7.x upgrade is required.
   - New installations require any external Elasticsearch Host, Cluster or Service to be on Elasticsearch v7.x.
   - Elasticsearch v5.6 was the previous version used by |morpheus|. Please refer to Elasticsearch Upgrade Documentation for upgrade instructions.
  .. important:: Elasticsearch 7.x is required for v4.1.2+. Running |morpheus| v4.1.2 with Elasticsearch 5.x or 6.x is NOT supported."

Appliance: Nginx now defaults to ``tls 1.2`` only
   The default Nginx config removes support for tls 1.0 and 1.1.
    - Some older OS's such as CentOS 6 will not be able to install the |morpheus| Agent or communicate with the Appliance without updating the image or configuring nginx to allow lower tls versions via morpheus.rb config.
    - Windows versions such as Windows 2008 require .net 4.5.2 minimum

Appliance: Redis removed
  Redis dependency has been removed for security enhancements. Redis is no longer installed or required.

Apps: Kubernetes: Spec-Based App: Parsing errors surfaced
  When provisioning Kubernetes Spec-Based Apps, syntax and/or parsing errors are now surfaced in the UI.

Azure: ARM Spec Templates & Layouts
  ARM Spec Templates & Layouts
  - Users can now create an ARM layout type and then select a Spec Template created with an ARM template.
  - The options in the ARM template then appear in the instance wizard. Upon provision, |morpheus| will look through the template and create matching resource records in |morpheus| mapped to those created in Azure. - - - Post-provision, records will also be created for any additional indirect resources that are created during provisioning.
  - ARM Spec Templates support Local, Repository and URL Sources.
  - Spec Templates: /provisioning/library/resource-specs"

Azure: ARM Templates: Custom naming of parameters for display
  Currently, the key in an Azure ARM template is used as the display name. See https://bertram.d.pr/13G6gf. Now, a user can specify 'fieldLabel' under the 'metadata' block for a parameter and that will be picked up and displayed as the label when provisioning.

Azure: CSP and EA price sync
  Azure EA (enterprise agreement) and CSP (Cloud Solution Provider) pricing support added.
   - ACCOUNT TYPE field added to Azure Cloud settings, with Standard, EA and CSP options.â€  The Account Type selection determines what prices are synced to |morpheus|. Standard is Default and the same prices synced in earlier versions.
   - To change an Azure Cloud Account Type from Standard to either CSP or EA pricing, in ``Infrastructure -> Clouds``, edit the target Azure Cloud. In the Details section, select Standard, CSP, or EA from the ACCOUNT TYPE dropdown. Select SAVE CHANGES. A new cloud sync will be triggered and the specified Account Type pricing will sync.
       .. note:: CSP and EA pricing sync is only available for Azure EA (Enterprise Agreement) and CSP (Cloud Solution Provider) subscriptions.

Azure: Virtual Networks filtered
  Parent Virtual Networks are no longer listed in Instance, App, Blueprint, Host, Reconfigure, Clone and Network Group Wizards, allowing clearer selection of appropriate Subnet(s).
  - Previously Virtual Networks would be displayed along with Subnets. If a Virtual Network was selection, |morpheus| would round-robin select a subnet in the vnet.
  - Use ``Network Groups`` to place appropriate subnets in a Network Group for round robin provisioning options.

Backups: (GB, 7 DAY TOTAL) added to SIZE OF BACKUPS widget.
  Title for "Size of backups" on /backups summary updated to make it clearer the values in the widget reflect the last 7 days and are in GB.

Backups: Tenant Backups Visibility added to Master Tenant
  Sub-Tenants Backups are now visible in the Master Tenant for Backups in Clouds owned by the Master Tenant and either shared Publicly or Private and assigned to a Sub-Tenant.

  - Tenant field added to Backup List ( /backups/list) and Backup Details ( /backups/show/{id}) pages.

Clouds: Security & Firewall configuration updates
   - Host Firewall and Local Firewall combined into Local Firewall
     - Enabling this will control ip table rules on Managed VM's and Hosts via Security Groups in Clouds without native Security Groups
   - Local Firewall and Cloud Native options removed from Security Server Options
     - Cloud Native security groups cannot be disabled so they are no longer a configuration option
     - Local Firewall is now controlled by Local Firewall setting instead of Security Server Setting
   - Security Server setting is for Security Service Integrations such as ACI

Clouds: Type and Status filters added
  In the Clouds List page /infrastructure/clouds, Clouds can now be filtered by status (All/Enabled/Disabled) and/or by Cloud Type

Clouds: `Cloud Init/ Unattend` default Agent Install mode
  The default AGENT INSTALL MODE setting for new Clouds is now set to ``Cloud Init / Unattend (when available) ``

  - The setting for existing clouds will not be changed.
  - `SSH / WinRM / Gust Execution` was previously the default setting and ` Cloud Init / Unattend (when available)` needed to be set manually, which is the recommended Agent Install mode.

Clusters: Create Cluster: Review Tab Enhancements
  The Review Tab in the Create Cluster wizard has been update with:
     - Added:
        VOLUME DETAILS, NETWORK DETAILS, SERVICE PLAN, POD CIDR, and LAYOUT
