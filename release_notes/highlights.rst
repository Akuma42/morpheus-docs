ServiceNow Integration Improvements
-----------------------------------

|morpheus| 5.2.0 brings improvements to the ServiceNow integration, including upgrades to incident surfacing, integration with service catalog items, and more.

- "|morpheus| Incident‚Äù alerts are now more insightful including links to the related Morpheus incident or check, severity information, and other details about the failing check
- Provision Service Catalog Items through the Morpheus ServiceNow plugin
- Added the capability to identify a MID server once on the properties page rather than setting it individually for each call
- Pricing data is now available to the ServiceNow plugin when ordering Service Catalog items. This is made available on the XML as a monthly price, users would have to modify the form UI to surface this information

Hide Blueprint fields
---------------------

Administrators have been able to lock Blueprint fields to restrict editing during App provisioning for a long time. Fields can now be hidden from view completely by toggling the lock/unlock icon to the hidden setting. When users provision Apps based on this Blueprint, they will not see hidden fields at all. This gives administrators additional flexibility to mask unneeded complexity from users.
