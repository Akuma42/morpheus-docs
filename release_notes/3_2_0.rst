v3.2.0
======


.. IMPORTANT:: Morpheus v3.2.0 introduces Global Search, which requires an Elasticsearch upgrade. Upgrade from previous versions of Morpheus to a 3.2.0 or later requires you to upgrade ElasticSerach to 5.4.1 or 5.x. We don't support ElasticSearch 6.x at this time.  This upgrade requires you to export and import your Morpheus ElasticSearch data if you want to retain logs, backup history, statistics, and check history of your instances. If you do not need or want to retain that data you can skip the ElasticSearch migration.  Upgrading to 3.2.0 will create a blank ElasticSearch node with no data. Your Morpheus layout configuration will determine how to migrate your ElasticSearch data: all-in-one, distributed high availability, or Morpheus clustered appliances. Please refer to upgrade instructions below the release notes.
