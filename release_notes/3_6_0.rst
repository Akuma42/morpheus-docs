Fixes

Ansible execution over command bus
..................................

Morpheus has removed the need for ssh or winrm for Ansible! The new Ansible execution over command bus feature allows running ansible over the |morpheus| agent command bus, removing the need for an ssh or winrm connection for Ansible, or any open incoming ports on the target host. The Morpheus Agent (which can be installed with no open incoming ports on the target vm/host as well) will pull and execute Ansible commands locally.

To enable Ansible execution over the |morpheus| agent command bus, edit you Ansible integration and select " Use Morpheus Agent Command Bus"

Ansible verbose logging mode
............................

When using Ansible execution over the Morpheus Agent command bus, verbose debug logging can be enabled but editing an Ansible Integration. Along with the "Use Morpheus Agent Command Bus" flag, "Enable Verbose Logging" is a new setting on Ansible integration settings that will output debug level logs for Ansible execution, visible in the Instance history section by selection the "i" bubble on an executed Ansible task.

File Share Storage Quotas
.........................

The new File Share Storage Quotas Policy type allows, you guessed it, setting Storage Quotas for File Shares.

To add, in ``Administration -> Policies`` add a new Policy, and select ``File Share Storage Quota``.

.. image:: /images/provisioning/automation/ansible/3_6_0_policies_file_share_quota_config



Then set the Name, give it a good description, set the size in GB, and scope it Globally or to a User.

.. image:: /images/provisioning/automation/ansible/3_6_0_policies_file_share_quota_select


Object Storage Quotas
......................

The new Object Storage Quotas Policy type allows, you guessed it, setting Storage Quotas for Object Stores.

To add, in ``Administration -> Policies`` add a new Policy, and select ``Object Storage Quota``.

.. image:: /images/provisioning/automation/ansible/3_6_0_policies_object_storage_quota_select



Then set the Name, give it a good description, set the size in GB, and scope it Globally or to a User.

.. image:: /images/provisioning/automation/ansible/3_6_0_policies_object_storage_quota_config


Disable Clouds now filtered
...........................

Previously, deselecting "Enabled" in a Clouds configuration settings only disabled sync and greyed it out in the Clouds list view. Now disabled clouds are filtered out/hidden in Instance, App, Host, Migration and Blueprint wizards.

.. NOTE:: If you disable a cloud to temporarily pause sync, be sure to re-enable it for provisioning.


Long Instance and Host names now wrap
.....................................

Instance and Host list pages now wrap long Instance and Host names, allowing for viewing the entirety of a long Instance or Host name without having to select or hover.

.. image:: /images/provisioning/automation/ansible/3_6_0_name_wrap

Huawei Cloud integration added
..............................

Huawei Cloud now available as a Cloud integration in Morpheus v3.6.0.

..................................

The path to fileshare is now displayed on the Isilon tab to make it easier for users to know how to mount the share in a VM
