Adding IP Pools to Networks

|morpheus| can automatically assign the next available Infoblox IP in an IP/Network Pool and create the corresponding DNS records, as well as remove the records upon teardown. To enable this, add an Infoblox IP/Network Pool to the `Network Pool` section on a Network(s).

#. Navigate to `Infrastructure - Network- Networks`
#. Select a Network name and EDIT, or select `ACTIONS - Edit`
#. In the `NETWORK POOL` section, search for and select the name of the IP/Network Pool.

   * Gateway, DNS and CIDR must be populated for static/pool IP assignment
   * Select `Allow IP Override` to allow selecting between DHCP, Static entry and Pool Selection at provision time
   * Deselect DHCP server if a DHCP server will not be used on the network (only static and/or IP Pool IP assignment)

#. Select :guilabel:`SAVE CHANGES`
