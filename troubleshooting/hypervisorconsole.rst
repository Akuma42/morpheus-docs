VMware Hypervisor Console

|morpheus| features Remote Console support directly to VMware ESXi hypervisors. To enable this feature a few prerequisites must be met:

* The |morpheus| appliance must have network access to the ESXi hosts within vCenter.

* Firewall settings need to be adjusted on each ESXi host. This can be done in vSphere under firewall configuration on the ESXi hosts. Simply check the gdbserver option for each required host, which will open up the necessary ports (starting at the 5900 range).

* The |morpheus| must be able to resolve the ESXi hostnames.

Now that the ESXi hosts are ready to utilize remote console, simply edit the cloud in |morpheus| via `Infrastructure â†’ Clouds`. Check the option that says Use Hypervisor Console. |morpheus| is now able to use the VMware Remote Console without opening any ports on the Virtual Machines.
