Contacts
========

To configure user notifications, a contact must first be created in ``Monitoring > Contacts``. These contacts can be one of a few types:

* **Contact:** Used for either Email or SMS
* **Web Hook:** Used for posting a notification to a web endpoint or Alert Ops
* **Slack Hook:** Used for posting notifications to a Slack channel (ex. https://slack.com/[Slack])
* **VictorOps:** Provides a web post format consistent with the required notification format for Victor Ops.

Most of these options provide convenient examples and information when configuring the contact. Once they are configured, contacts can freely be used to build `Alert Rules`.
