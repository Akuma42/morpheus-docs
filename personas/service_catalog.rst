Service Catalog Persona
=======================

The Service Catalog Persona presents a simplified catalog where users can select and deploy Instances or Blueprints with pre-defined configuration with just a few clicks and without presenting an overwhelming list of options.

Dashboard
---------

The default page for the Service Catalog Persona is the Dashboard. The Dashboard shows a selection of featured catalog items, a listing of the last few items the user has ordered, and a selection from the user's inventory.

Catalog
-------

The catalog shows the complete list of pre-defined catalog items available to the user for provisioning. Catalog items are not created in the Service Catalog Persona. For more on creating catalog items, see the Self Service section (Tools > Self Service) of |morpheus| docs.

Inventory
---------

The Inventory Page reveals the complete list of items which have been ordered by the user and provisioned. Users will only see their own items in this section.

Inventory Detail
----------------

Access the detail page for an item in your inventory by clicking the View Details link. The page displayed will look very similar to an Instance or App detail page in the Standard Persona. Highly detailed information on the health of the Instance or App are shown here. We can also take actions against Instances such as running Tasks or Workflows, reconfiguring the Instance, controlling the power state, and more.
