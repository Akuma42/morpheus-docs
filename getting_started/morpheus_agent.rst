Morpheus Agent
===============

The |morpheus| agent is an important and powerful facet of the |morpheus| platform.  After an initial brownfield discovery users can decided to convert unmanaged vms to managed. The agent is not required to by |morpheus| to become a managed instance but it does provide numerous additional benefits when it is utilized. Once a vm is managed it can run workflows, have expiration/shutdown policies and can help reign in enviornments amongst other things.
