VMware Support Statement
------------------------

|morphdat| will support customers who run |morpheus| products on supported operating systems, irrespective of whether they are running in VMware environments or not. |morphdat| supports operating systems, not specific hardware configurations. Accordingly, VMware operates as a hardware abstraction layer.

VMware supports a set of certified operating systems and hardware. The customer and VMware will be responsible for any interactions or issues that arise at the hardware or operating system layer as a result of their use of VMware.

|morphdat| will not require clients to recreate and troubleshoot every issue in a non-VMware environment; however, |morphdat| does reserve the right to request our customers to diagnose certain issues in a native certified operating system environment, operating without the virtual environment. |morphdat| will only make this request when there is reason to believe that the virtual environment is a contributing factor to the issue.

Any time spent on investigation of problems that may, in the sole opinion of |morphdat| be related to VMware, will be handled in the following fashion:

#. |morphdat| will provide standard support to all |morpheus| products.
#. If a problem is encountered while |morpheus| is/are running in a VMware environment, the client may be required to recreate the problem on a non-VMware server unit, at which time |morphdat| will provide regular support.
#. The client can authorize |morphdat| to investigate the VMware-related items at normal time and materials rates. If such investigation shows that the problem is VMware related, the client may contract |morphdat| to provide a software change to resolve the issue if such a resolution is possible.
#. Regardless of the problem type or source, if the problem is determined to be a non VMware-related issue, time spent on investigation and resolution will be covered as part of regular maintenance and support will be provided as usual.
