Import Trusted Certificates
---------------------------

.. IMPORTANT:: The following applies to upgrades after modifying the java keystore.

Steps to import trusted certificates to |morpheus| after an upgrade.

#. Obtain the full SSL certificate chain in PEM format.

#. Copy them to each appliance and place them in the ``/etc/morpheus/ssl/trusted_certificates`` directory.

#. Run morpheus-ctl reconfigure on each appliance, note you donâ€™t need to stop Morpheus before you run this.

#. Run the following command as root:

    .. code-block:: bash

        export PATH=/opt/morpheus/sbin:/opt/morpheus/sbin:/opt/morpheus/embedded/sbin:/opt/morpheus/embedded/bin:$PATH

#. Run the following command for each certificate in the chain, adjusting the file and alias name as needed. Answer yes for the root certificate when asked it you want to trust it.

    .. code-block:: bash

       /opt/morpheus/embedded/java/jre/bin/keytool -import -keystore /opt/morpheus/embedded/java/lib/security/cacerts -trustcacerts -file /etc/morpheus/ssl/trusted_certs/root_ca.pem -alias some_alias -storepass changeit

#. Verify by running:

    .. code-block:: bash

       openssl s_client -connect host:port -showcerts -tls1_2``

#. You should get an output similar to:

    .. code-block:: bash

        Verify return code: 0 (ok) #<----------------

#. If the certificates are installed correctly you should see ``Verify return code: 0 (ok)``.  If they were not installed correctly then you will see a return similar to: ``Verify return code: 21 (unable to verify the first certificate)``

#. Repeat for all App Nodes
