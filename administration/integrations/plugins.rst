Plugins
-------

|morpheus| is extendable with custom plugins for Task types, UI tabs, approvals, cypher, and more. Plugins are added from the Plugins tab of the Integration page under Administration (Administration > Integrations > Plugins). Simply browse for a local plugin file (.jar) to add it to the UI. Custom plugins can also be deleted by clicking on the trash can icon in the corresponding row.

Please see the Plugin Architecture SDK documentation for help getting started with custom plugin development.
