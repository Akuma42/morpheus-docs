Packages
--------

Overview 
^^^^^^^^

The ``/administration/packages`` is where |morpheus| packages (.mpg) can be uploaded to Appliances. |morpheus| packages contain Library objects, such as Instance Types, Layouts, Node Types, Spec Temples and Cluster Layouts. |morpheus| packages consist of library objects as code compiled into a simple ``$.mpg`` file, allowing for agile distribution, updated and sharing of Library configurations.

The addition of ``/administration/packages`` in |morphver| is targeted for uploading future |morpheus| provided mpg's, however users will be able to create, distribute and/or import custom |morpheus| packages.
