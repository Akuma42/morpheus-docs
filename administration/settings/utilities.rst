System administrators have access to a utilities panel with the following options:

- **Reindex all searchable data:** Execute
- **Toggle Maintenance Mode:** Enable

..NOTE:: Maintenance mode cleanly places |morpheus| into a state where maintenance can be performed on the appliance. This drains any active sessions and queues so an auto-scaling group can scale down. It also drains active sessions across services.
